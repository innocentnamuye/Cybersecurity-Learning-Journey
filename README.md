# Cybersecurity Learning Journey 🚀
This is the first step in my Cyber Security  journey. This entails all notes and project files, as well as the necessary image files. It will document my 6-week cybersecurity and networking sprint. As a Mechatronic Engineer pivoting into tech, I'm building hands-on skills through structured labs, daily reflections, and public documentation.

## 🔧 Focus Areas
- Command-line navigation (Windows/Linux)
- Networking fundamentals
- Cybersecurity tools and techniques
- GitHub documentation and automation

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `CyberLab/`: Daily labs, notes, screenshots
- `README.md`: Sprint overview and goals

## 🧠 Goal
To build a strong foundation for entry-level cybersecurity roles, especially in industrial systems and automation.
