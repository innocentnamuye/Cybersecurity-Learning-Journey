üöÄ **Day 1: Orientation & Goal Setting**

**üéØ Objectives:**
- Understand how TryHackMe works
- Explore the dashboard, streaks, and learning paths
- Set cybersecurity goals and specialisation focus

**üõ†Ô∏è Project Task:**
- Create a markdown file in my GitHub repo:
- Cybersecurity-Learning-Journey/Week1/Day1_Orientation.md


 **1. Why I am pivoting into cybersecurity**
      - I am pivoting into Cybersecurity for several reasons, the main one being my desire to contribute to building secure and fully autonomous systems for even better prognostics and fault detection in systems for better predictive and preventative maintenance.
      
 **2. What niche I am targeting**
      - I aim to branch into SCADA system security.  
      
 **3. What skills do I already have from mechatronics?**
      - I have basic coding experience in C, C++, Arduino and foundational knowledge in Python programming, which is concurrently a work in progress in this course. In addition, I have experience in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the Siemens Symatic and Mitsubishi Melsec series to be precise.
      
 **4. What do I want to achieve in 6 weeks?**
     - I am looking for two things in particular:
       a. To gain strong foundational knowledge in cybersecurity to allow me to seek further and deeper learning in terms of more detailed courses and certifications.
       b. I want to choose the best specialization route based on what I‚Äôve learned, despite my current inclination toward SCADA security.



‚úÖ **Day 1 Deliverables:**
- Complete the Welcome room
- Push my Day 1 markdown to GitHub
- Enrolled in Cisco NetAcad course: Cisco junior Cybersecurity Analyst course 
- Completed Module 1: Cybersecurity Overview
- Took notes on:
     1. Importance of cybersecurity in industrial systems
     2. Real-world examples of OT attacks (e.g., Stuxnet, Triton/TRISIS)
     3. Roles and responsibilities in a SOC (Security Operations Center)
