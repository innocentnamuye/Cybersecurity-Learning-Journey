🚀 **Day 1: Orientation & Goal Setting**

🎯 Objectives:
- Understand how TryHackMe works
- Explore the dashboard, streaks, and learning paths
- Set cybersecurity goals and specialisation focus

🛠️ Project Task:
- Create a markdown file in my GitHub repo:
- Cybersecurity-Learning-Journey/Week1/Day1_Orientation.md


Inside, document:
 **1. Why I am pivoting into cybersecurity**
      - I am pivoting into Cybersecurity for several reasons, the main one being my desire to contribute to building secure and fully autonomous systems for even better prognostics and fault detection in systems for better predictive and preventative maintenance.
 **2. What niche I am targeting**
      - I aim to branch into SCADA system security.  
 **3. What skills do I already have from mechatronics?**
      - I have basic coding experience in C, C++, Arduino and foundational knowledge in Python programming, which is concurrently a work in progress in this course. During my tenure at Centurion Systems LTD, I gained experience in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the Siemens Symatic and Mitsubushi Melsec series.
- What you want to achieve in 6 weeks

🏭 Industrial Relevance:
Think of TryHackMe as your virtual factory floor — each lab is a machine you’ll learn to operate, secure, and optimize. Today’s task is like your induction briefing before entering the plant.

✅ Deliverables:
- Complete the Welcome room
- Push your Day 1 markdown to GitHub
- Optional: Share a short LinkedIn post introducing your sprint
